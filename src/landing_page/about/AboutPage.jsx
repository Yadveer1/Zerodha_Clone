                        Hey! I'm Yadveer Singh Pawar, a Computer Engineering student with a strong passion for Web Development and Artificial Intelligence. I love turning ideas into real-world projects — like the Spotify clone and Wanderlust (my Airbnb-inspired web app). <br /> <br />
                        Right now, I'm sharpening my skills in Data Structures & Algorithms and diving deeper into full-stack web development. I'm always open to learning, building, and collaborating on meaningful tech projects. <br /> <br />
                        If you're looking for someone to join your team, internship, or just vibe over a cool side project — let’s connect! <br /> <br />
                        When I'm not coding, you’ll probably find me on a football field chasing the next goal ⚽ <br /> <br />
